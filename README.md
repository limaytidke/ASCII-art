# ASCII-art 

This is a personal project I have worked on as a beginner to improve my skills.
This repo contains two source code files (for now). One transforms images into ASCII. The other transforms videos. Currently the code is unfinished (I am lazy) and I am working to combine both files into one and add more custom features. I am gonna stop yapping now.

## USAGE 

### 1. image_convert.py

Inside the terminal type:

```
python image_convert.py filename.png
```

Currently there is only support for PNGs.

Example:

![[examples/cat.mp4]]


### 2. video_convert.py

Inside the terminal type:

```
python video_convert.py filename.mp4
```

Currently only MP4s and AVIs are supported (I think)

Example:

![[examples/bad_apple.mp4]]

## P.S

I currently still a beginner so you can expects bugs and errors. I will keep working on this project and try to make it better (hopefully). Thank you.
